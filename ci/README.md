# app-autoscaler-ci

This repository provides all public scripts and pipeline deployments used
by the app autoscaler team.  The public pipeline is hosted at: <https://bosh.ci.cloudfoundry.org/>.

To reproduce this pipeline, you can use your own private configuration files for the `pipeline.yml` files as described below.

## Autoscaler

This directory contains the concourse `pipeline.yml` for the autoscaler [pipeline](https://bosh.ci.cloudfoundry.org/pipelines/app-autoscaler)
and all of the associated scripts. To use this manifest, you need to provide a private configuration file
for all of the template parameters.

NOTE: If you are recreating this pipeline, for personal use and do not have authority to update
tracker or push to github. The `pipeline.yml` file needs to have any `tracker` sections commented
out as well as the app-autoscaler private key
