# the value is being calculated as follows:
#   - Diego cell size = 8 CPU 32GB RAM
#   - total shares = 1024 * 32[GB host ram] / 8[upper limit of app memory in GB] = 4096
#   - CPU entitlement per share = 8[number host CPUs] * 100/ 4096[total shares] = 0,1953%

# if this value changes, the acceptance test configuration related to metric type cpuutil needs to be adjusted as well
