# This operations file is used to set the CPU entitlement per share in for the garden process in the diego-cell job as follows:
# diego cell = 8 CPU 32GB RAM
#  total shares = 1024 * 32[gb host ram] / 8[upper limit of app memory] = 4096
#  CPU entitlement per share = 8[number host CPUs] * 100/ 4096[total shares] = 0,1953
