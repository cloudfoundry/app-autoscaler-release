## Requirements
* glcoud => 403.0.0
* helm => 3.10.0
* terraform => 1.3.1
* terragrunt => 0.39.0
* kapp => 0.53.0
* ytt =>  0.43.0
* vendir => 0.31.0
* kubectl => 1.23
* jq (if needed for other scripts ie. disaster recovery tasks, currently not in use)



# Prerequisites for a fresh project
Adjust `variables.tf`

Alternatively pass as env variables or vars files to terraform / terragrunt
#### Logon to your GCP account

```
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login
```

#### Create Github OAuth token and supply as a Google Secret
1. Request creation of a Google Secret

  ```
  terragrunt run-all plan --target module.concourse-infra.google_secret_manager_secret.github_oauth```
  ```

2. Create Github OAuth token

This is necessary if you want to be able to authenticate with your GitHub profile. Log on to github.com and navigate to:
"Settings" -> "Developer settings" -> "OAuth Apps" -> "New OAuth App"

As "Homepage URL", enter the Concourse's base URL. As "Authorization callback URL", enter the Concourse URL followed
by `/sky/issuer/callback`.

3. Please create a version for google secret using gcloud command or webui, with a foolowing key-vaule format

```
id: paste your Client ID
secret: paste your Client secret
```


### Import existing GCP resources to terraform state
to be removed soon
```
# terraform import google_dns_managed_zone.app-runtime-interfaces projects/app-runtime-interfaces-wg/managedZones/app-runtime-interfaces
# terraform import google_compute_network.vpc projects/app-runtime-interfaces-wg/global/networks/default
```


### Apply terrgrunt for infrastructure

```
terragrunt run-all plan
terragrunt run-all apply
```

### Obtain GKE credentials
( pending automation with tf )
```
> gcloud container clusters list
NAME   LOCATION        MASTER_VERSION   MASTER_IP     MACHINE_TYPE   NODE_VERSION     NUM_NODES  STATUS
wg-ci  europe-west3-a  1.23.8-gke.1900  34.159.31.85  e2-standard-4  1.23.8-gke.1900  3          RUNNING

> gcloud container clusters get-credentials wg-ci --zone europe-west3-a
Fetching cluster endpoint and auth data.
kubeconfig entry generated for wg-ci.

‚ùØ kubectl config current-context
gke_app-runtime-interfaces-wg_europe-west3-a_wg-ci
```

### Save secrets needed for DR scenario
This part is not intended to be fully automated.
```
cd ./concourse-dr/
terragrunt plan
terragrunt apply
```

---

## Pending rewrite
### Sync exernal repositories
You might wish to bump versions of software in [vendir.yml](vendir.yml) file
```
vendir sync
```
## Execute terragrunt / terraform
Since the stack contains separately managed infra, backend and app it would require user to `cd` into each module directory and execute terraform from there.

To simplify this we use [terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/) (with most basic functionality for now).


#### Manage the entire stack
```
# view incoming changes (if any)
terragrunt run-all plan

# execute changes
terragrunt run-all apply
```


# Upgrade components managed by kapp (when needed)
Required actions:
* changing charts versions
* `vendir sync`

Build lifecyce:
* managed by terraform.
* able to destroy/redeploy concourse app and corresponding 'backend' components separately

# Other matters
### DR scenario
Please see [DR scenario readme](concourse-dr/README.md)
#### Create hmac keys for concourse service account
TBD. Currently not required?

#### Secret rotation
Quark Secrets have been dropped.
* TBD process with Carvel Secret Manager
* TBD SQL users password update - might not be an issue due to the separation of concourse backend and app.
